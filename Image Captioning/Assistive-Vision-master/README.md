# Image-Captioning

An Image-to-Caption Generator web built using Machine Learning and Tensorflow js for Deployment.
The model itself is a combination of 2 principles, using CNN and LSTM.

To run, simply do these steps:
* Clone this repo and run `python -m http.server 8000`
* Wait until the model is nicely loaded (you will see 'Good to go!' on the page)
* Click upload to upload your image, and click 'Generate Caption' to witness the magic.
